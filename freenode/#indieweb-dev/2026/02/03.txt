That was the cardinal sin of Mastodon when they had all the initial Twitter exodus attention. The idea that they needed to \u201ceducate users\u201d by forcing them into picking a server (without a default fallback option that didn't come until later) is a breathtakingly bad piece of UX. One that they recognized and publicly admitted but it was too little","modes":["voice"]}
